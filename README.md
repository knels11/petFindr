# petFindr
Pet findr is a full stack application created to help owners track and organize the journey through life for their pets. The inspiration of this project started with recognizing the roles that our pets uphold in the lives of their humans. Its inevitable that pets become a piece of us as they become our furry, four-legged family members. This app was created to give thanks to our friends by prioritizing their day-to-day routines; and making sure their health and happiness is always noted.  With pet findr you can keep up with your pets; their health, age, upcoming appointments, and any necessary changes that may occur.
